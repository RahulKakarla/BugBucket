Functionality:
1.He can add an user:
  ->checks with email id, if the email exists in database he could not enter.
  ->Once user is added the user will get an email with his User Id and Password.
  ->user id is generated by system by getting the previous highest and incrementing in pattern(us_000).
  ->Banner messages will be shown when an user or technician is created

2.Adding Technician:
   ->Limitations: 
    --------------
        ->We are allowing only one user for one team, So once he added a technician for a team,he could not add another one.
          He can add more by deleting an existing tecnician
        ->Here also we check with email id.
